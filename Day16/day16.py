# -----------------Why do we need OOP - Object Oriented Programming?-------------------#
# Day 15 downwards we did procedural programming - we set procedures/ functions that do particular things.
# The code can be long, complex and confusing: Works from top to bottom and jumps to a function

# Object Oriented pradigm solves procedural programming issues
# Splits complex tasks into smaller pieces
# Different people can work on different modules simultaneously
# Each pieces become reusable if we need the same functionality in the future
