# -----------------Control Flow with if/else and conditional operators--------------------#
# Conditional if/else: Doing A or B depending on a condition
# print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
# height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# if height >120:
#     print("You can ride the rollcoaster!")
# else:
#     print("Sorry you have to grow before you can ride.")

# Comparison Operators
# >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

# Control Flow & Conditionals Exercise
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))

# if number % 2 == 0:
#     print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#     print("This is an odd number.")

# -----------------Nested if statements and elif statements--------------------#
# Nested if statemet: Once one condition is passed, we can check for another inside the if statement
# Another ifelse is inside the if statement
# if/elif/else: There are more than 1 conditions to check
# print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
# height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# if height >120:
#     print("You can ride the rollcoaster!")
#     age = int(input("What is your age? "))
#     if age < 12:
#         print("Please pay $5.")
#     elif age <= 18:
#         print("Please pay $7.")
#     else:
#         print("Please pay $12.")
# else:
#     print("Sorry you have to grow before you can ride.")

# Nested If Exercise: BMI2 Exercise
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese

# Solution
