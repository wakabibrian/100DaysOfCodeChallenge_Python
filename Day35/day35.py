# --- What is API Authentication and Why Do We Need to Authenticate Ourselves? --- #
# Authenticate ourselves so that we are more secure as we get data from API providers
# Some APIs require authentication
# Previously, they were free APIs. Some APIs can have a paid tier for commercial and fancy applications
# Some people sell APIs because of the costs involved
# Through API Key (personal account), the providers can track how much you are using their data
# hence authorise or denie access
