# -----------------Functions-------------------#
# Functions help our code to perform different functionality.
# Functions help to package a set of instructions together
# Built in functions
# print("Hello")
# num_char = len("Hello")
# print(num_char)

# # User Defined functions
# def my_function(): # Defining the function
#     print("Hello")
#     print("Bye")

# my_function() # Calling the function (Using the function)

# -----------------Indentation-------------------#
# Indentaion in python is of 4 spaces
# Used when creating blocks of code
# Recommended to use spaces to tabs

# -----------------While Loop-------------------#
# The loop will coninue going while a particular condition is true
# while something_is_true:
#   # Do something repeatedly

# number_of_hudles = 6

# while number_of_hudles > 0:
#     jump()
#     number_of_hudles -= 1

# Why choose while over for loop?
# for loops are good when iterating over something and you need to do something with each thing
# eg items in a list.
# while loops are good when you dont care about using an item, just carrying out something many many times until its false
